			The organization of the Elk Valley Advent Christian Church dates back to the year 1922, at that time an old school house on the hill across from Smith's Super Market was the meeting place for our church. The church was inter-denominational at that time and a Baptist minister named Rev. Ryan was one of the preachers for regular worship services. The location of the "Old" Elk valley Church, as referred to by many of our members, was located at the present site of our church today. <br>
			<br>
			The following people were known to be the Charter Members of our church:<br>
			<br>
			Robert Booker<br>
			Lizzie Booker<br>
			Barbara Edens<br>
			Jim johnson<br>
			Willie Edens<br>
			J. M. Withrow<br>
			Z. L. Huffman<br>
			Sarah Johnson<br>
			Daisy Lucas<br>
			Ella Copenhaver<br>
			John T. Hodges<br>
			Merideth P. Edens<br>
			Niza Huffman<br>
			Minerva Hodges<br>
			<br>
			One event that stands out in the mind of Sister Evelyn Copen was the presentation of a Christmas Program in the 1930's. The Church had gas lights at that time and Charles Pauley provided electricity
			that night by running extension cords from his home to the Church.<br>
			<br>
			Pastorship at the "old" Church was held by the following ministers:<br>
			<br>
			John Elmore(Date Unknown)<br>
			Dennis Moss (Date Unknown)<br>
			George Huffman(1938)<br>
			Forrest Burdette(1944-1945)<br>
			Homer Baxter (Date Unknown)<br>
			T. R. (Tom) Boggs(1937)<br>
			Cecil Nobel(1939-1943)<br>
			Janes Coleman(1946)<br>
			<br>
			Elk Valley's first pastor was Rev. John Elmore, founder of the Elmore Memorial Church in Charleston, Rev. Elmore rode the 6 a.m. train to Big Chimney for the 3 p.m.service. He would spend the day with his sister-in-law Mrs. Daisy Lucas and her husband Joe. Mrs. Lucas was one of the charter members. Rev. Elmore would again ride the train back to Charleston at 6 p.m. where he would preach at the evening services at the Elmore Memorial Church.<br>
			<br>
			The last service held in the former Church was on Mother's Day, May 12, 1947. On the following Monday morning demolition started with windows being renoved first.<br>
			<br>
			The Massey Methodist Church in Big Chimney offered our members the use of their church for our services. Sunday School and Worship services were held at 2 p.m. until our Church basement was completed. At that time, services were moved into our present Church using only the basement.<br>
			<br>
			In the fall of 1947, a large group of ladies from the Church met to organize the Ladies Aid Society. Prior to this time they met in the store building belonging to Mr Z. L. Huffman. This group grew with many women of the community joining. The Ladies Aid Society has played a great part in the Church since those early days, even today many of the Church's needs are supplied by this group. Not only were the ladies able to fellowship together and share their quilting talents, but they have often helped the Church financially with the cost of improvements and helping to send our children to Camp Whitney, we praise and thank God for all the women Who have helped in supporting this cause. The Ladies Aid Society has been instrumental in leading several of our women to Christ.<br>
			<br>
			Much of the financial part of the Church business in the early Years can be credited to Brothers Jesse M. Whithrow, Lon Huffman and Sister Ella Copenhaver. Brother Whithrow was a great support in fulfilling his part in the ministry of the Church.<br>
			<br>
			For many years Brother Huffman, known as the Father of the Church, would find it necessary to walk through the rain, snow or heat from his home near Little Sandy (on Rt. 119). After his son, Brother Eugene Huffman began to preach, Brother Lon would sit on the seat facing him on the platform, and he knew the scripture so well that Eugene was using he would move his lips repeating the scriptures with his son.<br>
			<br>
